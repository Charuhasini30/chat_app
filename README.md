Project Description

This project is a real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with WebSockets for the backend. It enables users to exchange messages instantly through a persistent WebSocket connection, ensuring low latency communication without page refresh.
Messages are stored in a MongoDB database (local MongoDB Community Server), and MongoDB Compass is used to visually inspect and manage stored chat data. The application demonstrates real-time system design, persistent connections, and full-stack integration.
